MacOSX port Notes
------------------

11/24/04

This version will build and run on MacOSX.

To build on JAGUAR (10.2)

cd $MOTIFBUILDDIR/extras/wchar/lib
make clean
make

before you do anything else. JAGUAR does not have wide character support.
The files in extras/wchar are the citrix wide character implementation for freebsd
that were subsequently incorporated into 10.3 (PANTHER)


On Jaguar, build with

export BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS="-DJAGUAR=1"

On PANTHER, Motif should build out of the box.
